# <font color='orange'>What are the things we will learn from this blog.</font>

- Neural network
- Neurons
- Single Neuron
- Multi layerd perceptron (multiple neurons)
- Training of Multi Layered perceptron with Backpropagation


## In order to understand something We have to ask questions.
### Make sure you should ask relevent questions. 
### <font color = 'red'>What is neural network ? </font>
ANS - collection of neuron form  a network to solve a complex task (lets say a mathametical function)

##### Here is an example where we can use a neural network to detect whether a given image is a Cat or Dog.

######  Excited ???? relax In this series of Neural Network we will learn several things in the upcomming time , Like in the above GIF.

Lets get start !!!

<font color = 'red'> From where on the earth " Neural Network " came ?
  
ANS - All these neural network things are inspired by biology .In human body and animals we have something called <font color = 'blue'>Nervous System </font>.  

OK!!!!  

then <font color = 'red'> what is Nervous System ?</font>  
ANS - Nevous System is Made up of diffrent kind or a special kind of cell in animals or human body which transmit singnals , the cell are called Neurons.  

GOT IT!!!

So <font color = 'red'> what are Neurons ?</font>
Neurons are the primary cell of the nervous system.They are responsible for transmitting electrical signslas to other cells.  
We have diffrent kind of neuron in our body like sensory neuron, motor neuron etc.These are the cell when you touch a hot plate they transmit signals to our spinal cord and brain that "hey thats hot ". 




### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jitendra-Dash/Basic-of-Neural-Network/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
